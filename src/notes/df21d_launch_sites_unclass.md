The DF-21D missile is part of China's medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) inventory, typically deployed by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). Some potential launch sites for DF-21Ds include military bases on the Chinese mainland, especially those close to the coast for better targeting flexibility against naval forces in the Pacific.

While exact, specific locations for DF-21D launch sites are difficult to determine due to military secrecy, here are some approximate areas where such missiles are likely deployed:

1. **Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province**:  
   This area is home to several PLARF bases. It is strategically located on the eastern coast of China, giving missiles a direct line of sight toward the East China Sea and the Pacific.

   - Approximate Coordinates: 34.6000° N, 119.2000° E

2. **Ningbo, Zhejiang Province**:  
   Zhejiang Province has military facilities that are considered part of China's missile defense and strike forces. Ningbo’s proximity to the coast makes it an ideal location for DF-21D deployment.

   - Approximate Coordinates: 29.8683° N, 121.5440° E

3. **Shantou, Guangdong Province**:  
   Shantou is located near the southern coast of China, which is crucial for coverage over the South China Sea. It’s well positioned to target U.S. naval forces operating in that region.

   - Approximate Coordinates: 23.3541° N, 116.6819° E

4. **Datong, Shanxi Province**:  
   Datong is inland but is a key base for PLARF ballistic missile units. While farther from the coast, the range of the DF-21D allows it to engage naval targets from deeper within China.

   - Approximate Coordinates: 40.0900° N, 113.3000° E

5. **Guangzhou, Guangdong Province**:  
   This region is heavily militarized, and the proximity to both the South China Sea and potential U.S. naval routes makes it a logical choice for DF-21D deployment.

   - Approximate Coordinates: 23.1291° N, 113.2644° E

6. **Xinyang, Henan Province**:  
   Henan Province is home to several missile bases and strategic reserves of China's missile forces. From here, DF-21Ds could still target areas within the South China Sea and the Pacific.
   - Approximate Coordinates: 32.1265° N, 114.1239° E

### General Trends:

- **Coastal Locations**: Coastal cities and military bases such as Ningbo, Shantou, and Lianyungang are favored for deployment due to their proximity to potential naval target zones in the East and South China Seas.
- **Inland Sites**: Sites like Datong and Xinyang allow for deeper inland deployment, leveraging the DF-21D’s range to cover broader areas, including the Second Island Chain.

If you're running simulations or analysis, these general regions provide good starting points for potential launch locations.
